<h1>PhD position available</h1>

<p>Please read the following before you contact me.</p>
<p>I have an opening for a fully funded PhD position. If you are interested in joining my research group, please send me your resume with your transcripts, as well as a detailed description of your mathematical background. A minimum requirement is to have taken an advanced probability class and a real analysis class in a mathematics department. Please also provide in your resume contact information for references that could write a recommendation letter for you (preferably mathematics professors). Mathematics students with no engineering background are also encouraged to apply.</p>
<p>Due to the high number of applications I receive, it is for me impossible to reply to all applicants. Please do not feel offended.</p>
